# Instagram clone with React and JavaScript

This project uses `React` (custom hooks, useContext, useState, useEffect, useRef), `Firebase` (Firestore/auth), `Tailwind CSS`, LoadTest, Lighthouse, Vercel, React Testing Library and Cypress E2E Testing.

This React project has multiple pages: 
* login
* sign up
* dashboard (to view/like/comment on photos)
* user profiles. 

The sign-in page connects to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, Firebase auth is used to store the user in the Firebase auth database.
